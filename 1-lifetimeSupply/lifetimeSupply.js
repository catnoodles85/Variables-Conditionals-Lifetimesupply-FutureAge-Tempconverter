// Exercise One - Computing a lifetime supply of your favorite snack!
//
// You just won a lifetime supply of your favorite snack.
//
// You are going to write a piece of code which will determine how much you
// will actually need to last the rest of your life.
//
// Step one:
// Prompt the user for three things.
// * The name of their favorite snack
// * The number of items of that snack they would eat in a day
// * Their current age.
//
// Store each of these things in descriptively named variables.
//
// Step Two:
// Calculate how many they would need to last them until they are 100!
//
// Hint: There are 365 days in a year.  Multiply that by the number of years until they are 100 years old.
// (100 minus their current age) That will give you the total number of days.
// Then multiply that by how many they would eat in a day.
//
// Store that number in a variable.  That is how many they will eat in their lifetime.
//
// Step Three:
// Print a sentence to the browser using document.write().
//
// Your sentence should describe how many of their snack they will eat.  Something like this:
//
// "Congratulations, you have won a lifetime supply of Snickers!<br/>You will receive 2 Snickers per day,
// for a grand total of 51100 Snickers."
//
// Concatenate together strings with your variables to form the message dynamically.
//
// Then test out your program with different numbers and snack!
//
// Write your code here ðŸ‘‡

let snack = prompt("Whats your favorite snack?");
let ageNumber = prompt("how old are you?");
let numPerDay = prompt("how many would you eat in a day?");
let maxAge = 100
let totalLifetimeNumber = numPerDay * (365 * maxAge - ageNumber);
document.write("Congratulations," + "you have just won a lifetime supply of " + snack + "!<br/>" + "You will recieve " + numPerDay + " per day!</br>" +
"For a grand total of " + totalLifetimeNumber);
